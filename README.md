### Module leaders

For each module, the README file must identify the lead developer and the contributors.
The leads should be evenly divided among the group members.

### Code identification

In all the source files (including POMs), please replace __A43__ with your group identifier.  
The group identifier is composed by Campus - A (Alameda) or T (Tagus) - and number - always with two digits.

This change is important for code dependency management, to make sure that your code runs using the correct components and not someone else's.


## Getting Started

The overall system is composed of multiple modules.

See the project statement for a full description of the domain and the system.

### Prerequisites

Java Developer Kit 11 is required running on Linux, Windows or Mac.
Maven 3 is also required.

To confirm that you have them installed, open a terminal and type:

```
javac -version

mvn -version
```

### Installing

To compile and install all modules:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

The integration tests are skipped because they require theservers to be running.
